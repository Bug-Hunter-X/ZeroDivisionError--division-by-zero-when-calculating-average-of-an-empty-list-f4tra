This repository contains a simple Python program demonstrating a common error: ZeroDivisionError. The program calculates the average of a list of numbers. However, if the list is empty, it will result in a ZeroDivisionError. The solution addresses this issue by implementing a check to handle the case of an empty list, returning 0 in that scenario.  This prevents program crashes and provides a more robust solution.
